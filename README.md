# Hi, I'm Charisse

Aspiring telecommunications engineer with a thing for Python, clean logic, and systems that actually *work*. I've spent somewhat more hours than I'd like to admit building and breaking things just to figure out how they tick. Self-taught and self-driven.

I don't just write code... I shape ideas into working systems with Python as my tool of choice.
