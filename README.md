# Hi, I'm Charisse

Aspiring software engineer with a thing for Python, clean logic, and systems that actually *work*. I've spent more hours than I'd like to admit building and breaking things just to figure out how they tick. Self-taught, self-driven, and probably overcaffeinated.

I don't just write code—I shape ideas into working systems with Python as my tool of choice. From scrapers and automation to APIs and the occasional experimental chaos, I like to get my hands dirty.
